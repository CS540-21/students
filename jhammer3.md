Hello class, my name is James Hammer. I am a second year graduate student here at UT and am pursuing my PhD in computer science - ideally, anyway. Last semester I TA'd for fundamentals of digital archeology, which seems to be a very similar class to this one! Currently, my advisor is Dr. Jian Huang and my research is in the field of data visualization systems. I seem to be the go-to front-end guy for anything javascript. I hope in the future to start working more on graphics programming, as that is currently my biggest interest.
