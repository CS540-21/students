Hello, my name is Nicholas West. I got my bachelor's in mathematics/computer science last semester, and this is my first year in graduate school. I enjoy a wide array of topics in CS, but my favorites are graph theory, automata theory, and their applications in visualization and optimization. I have no idea what to expect from this class (I thought it would focus a lot on Agile and team management) but it sounds like mostly the kind of text analysis work I did with CURENT based on the syllabus.
