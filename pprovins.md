Hey! I am Paul Preston Provins IV (GitHub: 3PIV) and I am a computer science major here at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.
I have been here at UTK since 2016 where I transferred in from Virginia Tech.
I got my undergraduate degree in 2019, a B.S. in Computer Science.
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. and this is my second year in the program.
I am from the border of Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennesse near a little town called Harrogate just inside of Tennessee's border (home of Lincoln Memorial University!).
Now, Knoxville is my home where I live with my wife.
My area of research is Data Visualization though my interests are mainly in Computer Graphics and Computer Vision (they are sort of like the inverses of each other!).
I enjoy playing guitar, working out, playing Dungeons and Dragons, and watching new movies with my wife.
